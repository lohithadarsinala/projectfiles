    <p> In the beginning there was a word , the word with the god, the word was the god. On the first day, God said, “Let there be a lot of light and darkness, and I will name the light as ‘Day’, and the darkness as the ‘night’, and it happened exactly as he said! On the second day, God decided that there should be an infinite amount of space all around the earth he was planning to create. He decided to call this sky ‘Heaven’. On the next day, he created seas and land with mountains, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
        He made the plants, grass, and fruits that would grow in the soil. The following day, he gave a final touch to the light and darkness by creating millions and billions of stars. The next day was very important to God. This was the day he created fish, aquatic animals, and birds. He wanted numerous little creatures, and that’s why there are millions of fish in the oceans and birds flying in the sky. He slept peacefully that night. 
        The next morning, he had an amazing plan to come up with animals that would roam the land. He said, “Today, I shall create all the animals for the beautiful land. If there is time left, then I shall create a man that can be just like me.” He thought that this plan was a very good idea. This was the seventh day, a Sunday. Since he worked very hard for seven days, God was very tired, and he decided to rest on that day.
        While he was resting, he decided to go to Earth and make the most beautiful garden. He named it the Garden of Eden. 
        The garden was filled with wonderful flowers and trees, and it has thousands of animals and birds running around.
